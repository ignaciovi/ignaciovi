# üåÆ Hi, I'm Ignacio (Nacho) Valdelvira

I'm a Data Scientist with experience as a Data Engineer and Software Engineer. My interest is in **finding and using data in a way that actually helps organizations make better decisions**. My proudest achievements are:
- üîß Built the Data Architecture of a startup from scratch using Modern Data Stack tools (BigQuery, DBT, Airflow and Airbyte). The architecture and rationale for the chosen tools are documented [here](https://medium.com/p/2b5a645efb40)
- üìÇ Created a set of data modeling layers, following [DBT best practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview). This ensured our company had organized and documented data. My background in Software Engineering has motivated me to incorporate best practices from software development into the data stack. Best practices include: CI/CD, unit testing, integration testing, and light but robust data governance, which enables every collaborator to make changes in an agile manner while adhering to established conventions. See my article on DBT pre-commit [here](https://medium.com/@ignaciovi/improve-data-quality-in-dbt-with-dbt-checkpoint-dd9e37909790). 
- üìä Collaborated closely with every area of the business to identify data needs and deliver impactful solutions. Some examples of completed projects include: patient profiling, churn forecasting, item stock forecasting (time series), A/B testing, hypothesis testing, key metrics definition
- üìö Developed several side projects (with more in progress) fueled by my interest in specific topics or tools I wanted to learn. See the list of projects below:

| Linkedin Company Enricher | This project attempts to infer the quality of an organization's culture based on employee role rotation. I.e. how long do employees stay at the company and is this an indicator of how good a company is to work for? | Python, BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, DBT, Google Data Studio | https://github.com/ignaciovi/job-hunt-company-analyser |
| Song Genre Prediction     | Attempt to predict the genre of a song based on audio analysis features from Spotify                                                                                                                                    | Python                                                          | https://github.com/ignaciovi/song-genre-prediction     |
| Tweet Geolocation Spain   | We propose a framework for estimating Twitter user's location based solely on the text of the tweets (using Spanish tweets)                                                                                                | Python                                                          | https://github.com/ignaciovi/tweet-geolocation-spain   |
| Wikipedia Newsletter      | Developed it to learn about AWS. Luigi running in EC2 that retrieved Wikipedia events and stored them in S3 and RDS                                                                                                        | Python Luigi, AWS (EC2, S3)                                     | https://github.com/ignaciovi/wikipedia-newsletter      |

## Data quotes that I enjoy

>Most of the work we do in data is in an effort to reduce entropy ‚Äî we model data to remove inaccuracies, we turn commonly asked questions into self-serve reports, and we funnel ad-hoc questions into a formalized request process. This kind of attitude is in our nature as data practitioners and largely serves us well. But in the case of driving decisions with data, we need to challenge our instincts and embrace the chaos.

>Reducing entropy is üëèsuch üëè a üëè great üëè way to describe the reality of data work at any reasonably large company. Data is not a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù kind of activity. Your dashboard will get stale in less than six months. Your key metrics will eventually have bad data in them. That machine learning model you spent all of last quarter developing will drift from its original fit. The environment in which your business operates is constantly changing, and so will the product or service that your business delivers. As a result, what is knowable about your business, about your product or service, is constantly changing too. And fast.
